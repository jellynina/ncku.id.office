# 成大工業設計 野生der管理系統

只是個想要值班好過點的菸酒生試圖做一個管理系統，工作日辦公室值班工讀生管理教室與設備借用。
As a PT in department office, I am trying to make daily routine more friendly.

目前整理出來的資訊在[g-drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ABbdssp7holFUk9PVA)

## User Story

PT sutudents in the office manage the classrooms keys and other equipments. TA students need to go to PT for access the keys and equipments for ID department's courses. We use paper forms and sticky notes for tracking the status of the objuects.

### Issue: losing track of the keys and equipments

If PT or TA doesn't follow the protocol to documet or return the objects correctly, then it will influence the proceding of the courses ,or even make lost the properties easily. Moreover, it cost our members a lot of time and effort for tracking and menagment which is not a sign for a top acadamic insitution. In my opinion, we desirve our time in more valuable thing to focus on. That will be to make the department better and persuing higher level of success in our academic production.


## What to do

- List out the routine process and objects
- Design of the user flow
- Design of the data truction
